 Set Up the Project:

Create a Java project and add the required libraries to your classpath.

2. Define User, Movie, and Rating Classes:


public class User {
    private int id;
    private String name;
    // Add other user attributes and getters/setters
}

public class Movie {
    private int id;
    private String title;
    private String genre;
    // Add other movie attributes and getters/setters
}

public class Rating {
    private int userId;
    private int movieId;
    private double rating;
    // Add other rating attributes and getters/setters
}
 Load Data:

Load user, movie, and rating data from your database or external data source.

 Collaborative Filtering:

Implement a collaborative filtering algorithm to generate movie recommendations based on user ratings and preferences. Here's a simplified example of a user-based collaborative filtering approach:


public class MovieRecommendationSystem {
    private List<User> users;
    private List<Movie> movies;
    private List<Rating> ratings;

    public List<Movie> recommendMovies(int userId) {
        List<Movie> recommendedMovies = new ArrayList<>();
        
        User user = getUserById(userId);
        if (user == null) {
            return recommendedMovies;
        }
        
        for (Movie movie : movies) {
            if (!hasUserRatedMovie(user, movie)) {
                double predictedRating = predictRating(userId, movie.getId());
                if (predictedRating >= 4.0) { // Customize this threshold
                    recommendedMovies.add(movie);
                }
            }
        }
        
        recommendedMovies.sort(Comparator.comparing(Movie::getTitle));
        return recommendedMovies;
    }

    private boolean hasUserRatedMovie(User user, Movie movie) {
        // Check if the user has already rated the movie
    }

    private double predictRating(int userId, int movieId) {
        // Implement a prediction algorithm (e.g., user-based collaborative filtering)
    }
    
    private User getUserById(int userId) {
        // Find a user by their ID
    }
}
 User Interface:

Implement a user-friendly interface (e.g., a command-line interface or a web application) that allows users to rate movies, provide feedback, and update their preferences.

 Testing:

Test your recommendation system with sample users and movie ratings.
